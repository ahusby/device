# do's and don'ts - nais-device

nais-device removes the need for full blown management of your box.
This means that there are some do's and don'ts. You have to agree to following to be 
admitted to the _program_.

 - Don't set up your device as a proxy. For anything!
 - Don't move credentials off your box and transport them elsewhere.
 
 - Do your best to secure your device
 - Do what you can to report any security shortcomings
 
And otherwise: Just be nais.
